# timed-coding-quiz


## Description

I was motivated to make this coding quiz to start to get comfortable with the basics of web APIs and to get comfortable with multiple functions.
I built this project to demonstrate local storage and countdown timers and switching questions.
I learned there are multiple ways to create a good quiz that is interactive and has penalties if you miss a question.

## usage 
As soon as you press start on the first question A timer will be started and if you get a question wrong you will be dinged 5 seconds.

after you go through all of the questions there is a leaderboard where you can put your initials and the computer will save it in a local storage for small data.
